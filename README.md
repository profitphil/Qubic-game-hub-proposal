## 2. Revenue Sources

* **Transaction Fees:** Small fee on each rewarded play (or only on **ranked mode** entries).
* **Cosmetics / Gacha:** Skins, frames, boosters and other non-pay-to-win purchases.
* **Streak Recovery:** Micro-fee to preserve streaks after a miss.
* **Ranked Entry Fees:** Players stake tokens to compete for seasonal prize pools.
* **Advertising (optional):** Programmatic ads routed through the SC for transparent payout rules.

---

## 3. Distribution Logic â€” Worked Example

**Example:** 100 tokens net inflow

* **50 tokens â†’ PRP (Player Reward Pool)**
* **15 tokens â†’ Operator Fee**
* **15 tokens  â†’ Treasury / Reserve**
* **10 tokens â†’ Shareholder Dividend Pool**
* **5 tokens  â†’ Charity**
* **5 tokens  â†’ Qubic burned**


> All percentages are parameters in the SC and may be adjusted by governance to meet growth and sustainability targets.

---

## 4. Shareholder Compensation

* **Pro-Rata Dividends:** Each shareholder receives a percentage of SDP proportional to their SC share.
* **Scheduled Payouts:** Weekly executed trustlessly by the SC.
* **Growth Incentives:** Optional reinvestment toggle to **auto-compound** dividends back into PRP or Treasury.
* **Transparency:** On-chain accounting with public dashboards for pool balances and historical distributions.

---

## 5. Player Sustainability

* **Fair Emissions:** Rewards scale with difficulty/engagement and are **capped to prevent abuse**.
* **Seasonal Ladders:** Funded by entry fees + a defined slice of PRP â†’ sustainable competitive loop.
* **Cosmetic Sinks:** Deflationary pressure that absorbs inflation and keeps tokens circulating.
* **Integrity:** Security, anti-botting, rate limits and proof-of-play hooks at the API/SC layers.

**âœ… Net Result**

* **Players:** fun + consistent rewards.
* **Operator:** predictable revenue to run and grow the game.
* **Shareholders:** sustainable, recurring dividends that grow with adoption.
