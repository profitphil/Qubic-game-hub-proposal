## 1. Introduction  

The **Qubic Game Hub** introduces mainstream players to Qubic through addictive, fun, and blockchain-backed games.  

The first title, **Qubic Quest**, is a **Candy Crushâ€“style puzzle game** where players can enjoy casual free play or competitive ranked modes. Beyond this flagship launch, the Hub will expand into quick-play arcade and chance-based games, creating **continuous token sinks, engagement, and ecosystem growth**.

A **Candy Crushâ€“style puzzle game** with two modes:
