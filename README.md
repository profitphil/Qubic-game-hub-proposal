## 1. Revenue & Reward Pools

### 1.1 Player Reward Pool (PRP)

* **Purpose:** Funds all in-game rewards that drive engagement and retention.
* **Allocation:** *Configurable; example **50%** of net inflows.*
* **Covers:** Session rewards, streak bonuses, missions, seasonal ladders.
* **Outcome:** Keeps players motivated, increases daily active users, and improves loyalty.

### 1.2 Operator Fee (OF)

* **Purpose:** Guaranteed revenue to operate and improve the product.
* **Allocation:** *Fixed **10‚Äì15%** of all inflows (before other splits).*
* **Covers:** Infrastructure, development, support, security and ongoing updates.

### 1.3 Shareholder Dividend Pool (SDP)

* **Purpose:** Passive income to Smart-Contract (SC) shareholders that aligns long-term growth.
* **Allocation:** *Configurable; example **30‚Äì40%** of net inflows held for distribution.*
* **Payout Cadence:** Weekly or seasonal distributions governed by the SC.

### 1.4 Treasury / Reserve

* **Purpose:** Strategic buffer for events, marketing, liquidity and contingency.
* **Allocation:** *Optional **5‚Äì10%*** maintained by the SC treasury.

---

## 2. Revenue Sources

* **Transaction Fees:** Small fee on each rewarded play (or only on **ranked mode** entries).
* **Cosmetics / Gacha:** Skins, frames, boosters and other non-pay-to-win purchases.
* **Streak Recovery:** Micro-fee to preserve streaks after a miss.
* **Ranked Entry Fees:** Players stake tokens to compete for seasonal prize pools.
* **Advertising (optional):** Programmatic ads routed through the SC for transparent payout rules.

---

## 3. Distribution Logic ‚Äî Worked Example

**Example:** 100 tokens net inflow

* **50 tokens ‚Üí PRP (Player Reward Pool)**
* **15 tokens ‚Üí Operator Fee**
* **30 tokens ‚Üí Shareholder Dividend Pool**
* **5 tokens  ‚Üí Treasury / Reserve**

> All percentages are parameters in the SC and may be adjusted by governance to meet growth and sustainability targets.

---

## 4. Shareholder Compensation

* **Pro-Rata Dividends:** Each shareholder receives a percentage of SDP proportional to their SC share.
* **Scheduled Payouts:** Weekly or monthly cycles, executed trustlessly by the SC.
* **Growth Incentives:** Optional reinvestment toggle to **auto-compound** dividends back into PRP or Treasury.
* **Transparency:** On-chain accounting with public dashboards for pool balances and historical distributions.

---

## 5. Operator Benefits

* **Guaranteed Income:** A fixed **Operator Fee** on all inflows.
* **Secondary Upside:** If the operator also holds SC shares, they participate in **dividends** (fee + dividend ‚Äúdouble-dip‚Äù).
* **Aligned Incentives:** More active players ‚Üí larger pools ‚Üí stronger dividends ‚Üí healthier ecosystem.

---

## 6. Player Sustainability

* **Fair Emissions:** Rewards scale with difficulty/engagement and are **capped to prevent abuse**.
* **Seasonal Ladders:** Funded by entry fees + a defined slice of PRP ‚Üí sustainable competitive loop.
* **Cosmetic Sinks:** Deflationary pressure that absorbs inflation and keeps tokens circulating.
* **Integrity:** Security, anti-botting, rate limits and proof-of-play hooks at the API/SC layers.

**‚úÖ Net Result**

* **Players:** fun + consistent rewards.
* **Operator:** predictable revenue to run and grow the game.
* **Shareholders:** sustainable, recurring dividends that grow with adoption.
