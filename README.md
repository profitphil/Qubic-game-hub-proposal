## 1. Key Features

* **On-Chain Rewards:** Smart contract (SC) automatically splits revenue into Player Rewards, Operator Fee, Shareholder Dividends, Treasury/Reserve, Charity, and Burn (deflation).
* **Fair & Transparent:** All earnings, reward rules, and distributions are executed on-chain with public balances and histories.
* **Sustainable Loops:** Ranked entry fees + PRP funding support seasonal ladders, missions, and streaks without runaway emissions.
* **Deflationary Utility:** A fixed share of revenues is burned each cycle, reducing circulating Qubic supply.
* **Shareholder Dividends:** SDP pays pro-rata distributions to SC shareholders on a weekly cadence.
* **Charity Support:** Dedicated percentage of inflows is routed to approved charities via SC logic.
* **Multi-Platform Launch:** Web (desktop) and mobile (iOS/Android) builds to reach mainstream users.
* **Integrity & Safety:** Anti-bot measures, rate limiting, and proof-of-play checks to keep rewards fair.

## 2. Solutions Offered by Qubic Quest

* **Utility for Qubic Tokens** Converts gameplay, cosmetics, and ranked entries into real token sinks and on-chain activity.
* **Inflation Concerns** Mitigates supply growth through a built-in burn allocation on every epoch.
* **Player Retention & Engagement** Missions, streaks, and seasonal ladders keep users returning while aligning rewards to effort.
* **Trust & Transparency** Revenue splits, pool balances, and dividend payouts are enforced by the SC on-chain.
